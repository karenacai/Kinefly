# Installation Instructions for Kinefly.
# --------------------------------------------
# You need ROS, a camera to supply a ROS image stream, and Kinefly.  If you want to control voltages, then you'll need the PhidgetsAnalog hardware w/ Phidgets API.  If you want to control LED panels, then you'll need panels, see below.  There might be more stuff, but that's the basic setup.


# Install ROS Indigo on Ubuntu.
# Go to the ros.org website, and follow the installation instructions


# Get a few additional pieces.
sudo apt-get install -y python-setuptools
sudo apt-get install -y python-numpy
sudo apt-get install -y python-scipy
sudo apt-get install -y libdc1394-22-dev
sudo apt-get install -y intltool
sudo apt-get install -y gobject-introspection

# Run the following commands (adjust them first if necessary).
mkdir -p ~/catkin/src
mkdir ~/src.git
cd ~/src.git
echo "source ~/catkin/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=~/src.git:~/src.hg:~/catkin:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH" >> ~/.bashrc    # (Assuming your ROS projects are in these two directories).


# Reboot the computer.
# sudo reboot


# Get & make camera1394 ROS drivers.
cd catkin/src/
git clone https://github.com/ros-drivers/camera1394.git
cd ~/catkin
catkin_make


# Verify that your camera hardware is configured properly, i.e. download and install coriander to test firewire camera:
sudo apt-get install coriander
plug the camera into the computer and run
coriander
Under the Services tab, click Display and you should see a live image from the camera.


# Get & make both "libphidget" and "PhidgetsPython"
# Download & extract the file http://www.phidgets.com/downloads/libraries/libphidget.tar.gz
cd libphidget
./configure 
make && sudo make install 
# Download & extract the file http://www.phidgets.com/downloads/libraries/PhidgetsPython.zip
cd PhidgetsPython
sudo python setup.py install


# Get the LED Panels ROS node.
cd ~/src.git
git clone https://github.com/ssafarik/ledpanels


# Get phidgets ROS node.
cd ~/src.git
git clone https://github.com/ssafarik/phidgets


# Get & make the Kinefly software.
git clone https://github.com/ptweir/Kinefly.git
sudo cp ~/src.git/Kinefly/udev/99-phidgets.rules /etc/udev/rules.d
rosmake Kinefly


# Think of a name for your rig (e.g. yourrigname), and tell Kinefly about it.
# See the Kinefly/launch directory for examples, and you can copy one of those
# directories. 
cd Kinefly/launch
ls
cp -R polarization yourrigname
echo "export RIG=yourrigname" >> ~/.bashrc
. ~/.bashrc


# Edit the new files as per your needs (ethernet or firewire camera, camera exposure, tracking parameters, etc). 
cd yourrigname
gedit source_camera.launch
gedit params_camera.launch
gedit params_kinefly.launch
...etc...



# You're done!
# Assuming that you got here successfully, then you 
# should be able to run Kinefly, for example:
roslaunch Kinefly main.launch
